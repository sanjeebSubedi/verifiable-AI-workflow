# **NVIDIA Announces Financial Results for First Quarter Fiscal 2026**

- **Revenue of \$44.1 billion, up 12% from Q4 and up 69% from a year ago**
- **Data Center revenue of \$39.1 billion, up 10% from Q4 and up 73% from a year ago**

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the first quarter ended April 27, 2025, of \$44.1 billion, up 12% from the previous quarter and up 69% from a year ago.

On April 9, 2025, NVIDIA was informed by the U.S. government that a license is required for exports of its H20 products into the China market. As a result of these new requirements, NVIDIA incurred a \$4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 diminished. Sales of H20 products were \$4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 prior to the new export licensing requirements. NVIDIA was unable to ship an additional \$2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the first quarter.

For the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 60.5% and 61.0%, respectively. Excluding the \$4.5 billion charge, first quarter non-GAAP gross margin would have been 71.3%.

For the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were \$0.76 and \$0.81, respectively. Excluding the \$4.5 billion charge and related tax impact, first quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been \$0.96.

"Our breakthrough Blackwell NVL72 AI supercomputer — a 'thinking machine' designed for reasoning— is now in full-scale production across system makers and cloud service providers," said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. "Global demand for NVIDIA's AI infrastructure is incredibly strong. AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate. Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure — just like electricity and the internet — and NVIDIA stands at the center of this profound transformation."

NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of \$0.01 per share on July 3, 2025, to all shareholders of record on June 11, 2025.

# **Outlook**

NVIDIA's outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows:

- Revenue is expected to be \$45.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. This outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately \$8.0 billion due to the recent export control limitations.
- GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 71.8% and 72.0%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The company is continuing to work toward achieving gross margins in the mid-70% range late this year.
- GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately \$5.7 billion and \$4.0 billion, respectively. Full year fiscal 2026 operating expense growth is expected to be in the mid-30% range.
- GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are expected to be an income of approximately \$450 million, excluding gains and losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities.
- GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.

# **CFO Commentary**

Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA's executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com.

# **Conference Call and Webcast Information**

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its first quarter fiscal 2026 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA's investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA's conference call to discuss its financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2026.

# **Non-GAAP Measures**

To supplement NVIDIA's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA's investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains/losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, H20 excess inventory and purchase obligation charges, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. The inclusion of H20 excess inventory and purchase obligation charges in the reconciliations to adjust the related GAAP financial measures was a result of the U.S. government informing NVIDIA on April 9, 2025 that it requires a license for export to China of H20 products. H20 products were designed primarily for the China market. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company's non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
